# Synopsis

Locate & learn about points of interest during your trip on the HSR!

TransitTourist is a work-in-progress.

It's a prototype product that came out of the HSR Real-Time Data Hackathon put on by Open Hamilton.  It relies on open data from the Hamilton Street Railway and the City of Hamilton.

# Design Considerations

- Should locate and map the users location
- Should not store personal information 
- Should allow user to selectively layer datasets into the application
- Should use existing FOSS libraries where possible (ie. OpenLayers)
- Should use open API's where possible (ie. OpenStreetMaps)
- Should start simple with 1 layer based on an existing open data set

# Next Steps
- Add marker for user's location using the HTML5 geolocation api
- Add POI markers using open dataset
- Add bus locations & route information (ie. stops, detours)
- Wrap HTML5 app with Cordova
- A project name
- Code & Data licenses
- Clean up repo (we don't need the full OpenLayers distribution)
- Additional data layers (events, civic activities, etc)
